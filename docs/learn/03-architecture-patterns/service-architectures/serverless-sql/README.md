## Key Features

- On-demand querying with no infrastructure to manage
- Pay-per-query cost model
- T-SQL compatibility
- Native integration with Azure Data Lake Storage
- Built-in data virtualization
- Seamless integration with visualization tools

## Architecture Overview

![Serverless SQL Pool Architecture](../../diagrams/serverless-sql-architecture.svg)

Serverless SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics provide a serverless distributed query processing engine for big data analytics. The architecture is designed to support on-demand query execution over data stored in your data lake without the need to manage infrastructure.

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Organization

Organize your data lake with a clear folder structure to optimize query performance:

```text
adls://data/
├── raw/
├── curated/
│   ├── dimensions/
│   └── facts/
└── external/
```

### File Formats and Optimization

For best performance with Serverless SQL:

- Use Parquet for columnar storage benefits
- Partition large datasets appropriately
- Create statistics on frequently queried columns
- Use external tables with OPENROWSET for flexibility
