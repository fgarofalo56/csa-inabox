# CSA Loom v3 — Tenant bootstrap (post-deploy one-time config)

This doc captures the **one-time, per-tenant admin actions** that a Loom
deployment needs but that bicep can't fully automate (cross-cloud resources,
data-plane RBAC granted in a portal, tenant-level service enablement). Each
section is referenced from the in-app honest gate (the Fluent `MessageBar`
that names the exact step), per `.claude/rules/no-vaporware.md`.

## Microsoft Purview (Unified Catalog) {#microsoft-purview-unified-catalog}

Loom's **Governance** and **Unified Catalog** surfaces run natively against a
Microsoft Purview account's data plane (`<account>-api.purview.azure.com`):
governance domains, data products, glossary, Data Map sources/scans, lineage,
classifications, and access policies.

The Console resolves its Purview account from the `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT`
environment variable. When that is set and reachable, every governance control
goes live; otherwise the in-app gate shows exactly what's below.

### Why a one-time step is sometimes required

- **Greenfield tenant (no Purview yet):** set `purviewEnabled = true` and bicep
  creates `purview-csa-loom-<region>` and wires `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT` for you.
  See `platform/fiab/bicep/modules/admin-plane/catalog.bicep`.
- **Existing Purview, same cloud:** keep `purviewEnabled = false`, set
  `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT` to the existing account's short name, and grant the
  Console UAMI the data-plane roles (below). See
  `docs/fiab/runbooks/purview-tenant-reuse.md`.
- **Cross-cloud (the common blocker):** if the only Purview in the tenant lives
  in **US Gov** but the Loom Console runs in **Commercial** (or vice-versa),
  the data plane **cannot** be reached across sovereign clouds with one account
  name. The Console's `probePurview()` reports `cross_cloud`. Provision a
  Purview account in the **Console's** cloud and point `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT`
  at it. There is no env-var-only fix for cross-cloud.

### Step 1 — Provision / choose a Purview account in the Console's cloud

```bash
# Greenfield: let bicep do it
#   platform/fiab/bicep/params/<cloud>.bicepparam
#   param purviewEnabled = true
# then re-dispatch the admin-plane deploy.

# Or reuse an existing account in the SAME cloud as the Console:
EXISTING_PURVIEW="purview-corp-prod"   # short name, NOT the full URL
```

### Step 2 — Set `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT` on the Console app

```bash
az containerapp update \
  --name <loom-console-app> \
  --resource-group <loom-admin-rg> \
  --set-env-vars LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT="$EXISTING_PURVIEW"
```

The Console accepts either the short account name or a full
`https://<account>-api.purview.azure.com` URL (it normalizes to the short name).

### Step 3 — Grant the Console UAMI the Unified Catalog data-plane roles

These are **Purview governance-domain roles granted in the Purview portal**,
not ARM RBAC. Grant all three to the Loom Console UAMI
(`LOOM_UAMI_CLIENT_ID` / its object id):

| Role | Scope | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Curator** | Governance domain | Read business domains, glossary terms, governed assets. |
| **Data Product Owner** | Governance domain | Create / publish / update data products via the Unified Catalog plane. |
| **Data Reader** | Data Map collection | Browse assets, lineage, scans, classifications. |

In the Purview portal: **Settings → Roles and scopes → Governance domain →
Add** the UAMI to each role. (Data Map collection roles are under
**Data Map → Collections → Role assignments**.)

### Step 4 — (Optional) Register Loom data sources + scans

To populate the Data Map, register the Loom lakehouse/Synapse/Databricks
storage as Purview sources and schedule scans. This can be done from the Loom
**Governance → Scans & sources** surface (Register source + Run now) once the
account is wired, or via `az purview source/scan` — see
`docs/fiab/runbooks/purview-tenant-reuse.md` for the CLI recipe.

### Step 5 — Verify

Open **Governance** in the Console. The Purview status banner should flip to a
green **"Connected — `<account>` · live"** chip. **Governance → Scans &
sources** lists registered sources; **Unified catalog → Governance domains**
lists/creates domains. If you still see the warning gate, click **Recheck** and
read the reported reason (`not_configured` → env var unset on the app;
`cross_cloud` → wrong cloud; `upstream_error` → role grant / firewall).

### Bicep sync

- Resource + env var + admin role: `platform/fiab/bicep/modules/admin-plane/catalog.bicep`
  (`Microsoft.Purview/accounts`, the `LOOM_PURVIEW_ACCOUNT` env wiring in
  `admin-plane/main.bicep`, and the Data Curator role assignment).
- The three governance-domain roles in Step 3 are **portal-only** data-plane
  RBAC and intentionally cannot be expressed in ARM/bicep — hence this runbook.
