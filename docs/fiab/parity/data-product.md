# data-product — parity with Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog data product

Source UI: Purview Unified Catalog → Data products
(https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/unified-catalog-data-products-create-manage),
Unified Catalog REST (https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/purview/unified-catalog-api-overview),
glossary terms (https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/unified-catalog-glossary-terms-create-manage).

## Purview feature inventory

| # | Capability | Purview surface |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Product details (name, description, type, owner/contacts, SLA/terms) | data product details |
| 2 | Governance domain assignment (businessDomainId) | domain picker |
| 3 | Datasets / data assets mapped to the product | "Add data assets" |
| 4 | Glossary terms linked | Related → Add glossary term |
| 5 | Classifications on assets | asset classifications |
| 6 | Publish to catalog (Draft → Published) | Publish |
| 7 | Access policies (request workflow, time limit, approvers) | Manage policies |
| 8 | Lineage of mapped assets | lineage graph |

## Loom coverage

| # | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | built ✅ | form (displayName/description/owner/SLA/certified) |
| 2 | built ✅ | **Governance domain Dropdown** — GET `/api/catalog/domains` resolves label→businessDomainId GUID (the Phase-2 gap called out in register-purview is now closed; the disabled SLA/Owner/Semantic-schema ribbon buttons are REMOVED) |
| 3 | built ✅ | Datasets tab: register Atlas entities via POST `/api/catalog/register` and list them in the bundle; classifications attach inline |
| 4 | built ✅ | Glossary tab: list/create terms (`/api/catalog/glossary`) and link to the product asset |
| 5 | built ✅ | Classifications field on the register-asset form (Atlas `classifications[]`) |
| 6 | built ✅ | Register/Re-register with Purview → POST `/register-purview`; honest 501 hint when Purview unprovisioned |
| 7 | built ✅ | Access policies tab → GET/POST `/api/governance/policies` (kind=Access) — time limit + approvers |
| 8 | built ✅ | Lineage tab → GET `/api/catalog/lineage?source=purview&id=<guid>` rendered as a node/edge list |

## Backend per control

- Product → Cosmos `state` + `registerDataProduct` (Unified Catalog)
- Domains → `listBusinessDomains`
- Datasets/classifications → `registerAtlasEntity`
- Glossary → `createAtlasGlossaryTerm` / `applyGlossaryTerm`
- Lineage → `getLineageSubgraph`
- Access policies → Cosmos tenant-settings policies doc
- Honest gate: Purview unprovisioned → structured 501 hint MessageBar (env var + bicep module + roles).
